# Spatial Auxetic
The repository stores working codes for geometry analysis to generate mechinisms stated in a scientific paper [Programming Flat-to-Synclastic Reconfiguration](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330855223_Programming_Flat-to-Synclastic_Reconfiguration) and [Automating Bi-Stable Auxetic Patterns for Polyhedral Surfaces](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Bistable-Auxetic-System)

The current version is in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and Rhino7/Grasshopper format.

Required plugin for Grasshopper implementation: [MeshEdit](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/meshedit) and [Ngon](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/ngon)
